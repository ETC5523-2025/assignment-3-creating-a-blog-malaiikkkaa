# Hi there!

I’m a Master of Business Analytics student with a background in economics and marketing.  
My academic and professional experiences have focused on sustainability consulting and data analysis, where I’ve explored the intersection of climate challenges and business decision-making.  
I’m particularly interested in how data can be used to uncover insights on climate, economics, and corporate strategy.
