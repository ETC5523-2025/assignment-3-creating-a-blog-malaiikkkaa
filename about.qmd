# Hi there!

My name is Malaika Fernandes, and I’m currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University. I previously completed my Bachelor of Commerce at the University of Melbourne, majoring in Economics and Marketing.

My academic and professional experiences have centred on sustainability consulting and data analysis, where I’ve worked on projects exploring how data-driven insights can guide sustainable business decisions. From evaluating climate-tech investment opportunities to improving operational efficiency in organisations, I’m passionate about finding practical ways to align climate goals with economic outcomes.

Beyond my studies, I love exploring creativity in everyday life — whether that’s thrifting unique finds, going to music festivals, or trying new foods around Melbourne. These experiences keep me curious and open-minded, values I bring into both my work and my approach to problem-solving.
